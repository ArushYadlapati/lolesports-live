                        The betting system uses an unaffiliated (meaning that I don't make any commissions) betting website called <a href="https://www.bet365.com/" className="underline { scheme.foreground }" target="_blank"> bet365</a>.
                        Specifically, it uses the <a href="https://www.co.bet365.com/#/AC/B151/C1/D50/E3/F163/" className="underline { scheme.foreground }" target="_blank"> League of Legends section</a> of their website. It is a match betting website
                        that allows you to bet with REAL MONEY on that League of Legends esports match.

                        I do <strong>NOT</strong> recommend gambling with REAL MONEY. Betting on any form of Esports is a form of gambling.
                        I added this because adding my own betting system is way harder, and I don't want to deal with a login system and a database.
                        Thank you for understanding.
                    </p>

                        bet365 was chosen because it was a simple website that allowed me to get the link without too much work.
                        It didnâ€™t have an API however, so that made getting the information a bit tricky (but still possible).
